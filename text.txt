React Only Updates What’s Necessary:-

1)React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

Components and Props:-

    Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. 

    components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

Props are Read-Only

    Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props.Consider this sum function:

    function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
    }

    Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

    In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

    function withdraw(account, amount) {
    account.total -= amount;
    } 

All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Converting a Function to a Class
You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

   1. Create an ES6 class, with the same    name, that extends React.Component.
   2. Add a single empty method to it called render().
   3. Move the body of the function into the render() method.
   4. Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
   5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

“lifecycle methods”.

    The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.
